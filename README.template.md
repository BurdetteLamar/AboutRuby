# About Ruby

Ruby topics, with emphasis on:
* Working example code for (just about) everything.
* Completeness, including explication of exceptions raised.

## But Why?

I started out putting up doc-only PRs for the Ruby project itself.  These were meant to enhance the documentation there, especially adding example code and exception handling.

Problem is, everyone's busy, so it can be days or even weeks before even a small PR is merged.  So I'm stashing my stuff here as I write it.

I'll still try to keep the PRs in motion, to gradually get some of this merged.
